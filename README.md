# Multi-Tenant E-commerce Microservices

## Overview

The **Multi-Tenant E-commerce Microservices** platform is a highly scalable, distributed microservices architecture designed to handle millions of requests efficiently. This platform allows corporations or individuals to create accounts, add multiple sub-admins, create multiple stores, and assign sub-admins to stores with customizable permissions. 
It provides a comprehensive and centralized admin dashboard to manage sub-admins, stores, products, media, customers, orders, and analytics for each store, as well as the entire corporation.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Each corporation or individual can manage multiple stores with distinct sub-admins and customizable permissions.
- **Scalability**: Utilizes various architectural patterns, concurrency techniques, GRPC, and GraphQL with WebSocket to handle millions of requests efficiently.
- **CQRS and SAGA Pattern**: Implements CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for scalable query handling and SAGA for managing distributed transactions.
- **Kafka for Asynchronous Operations**: Ensures efficient handling of asynchronous operations and inter-service communication.
- **GraphQL API**: Provides a GraphQL API for store-related services, allowing efficient querying with a single endpoint to build fully functional e-commerce applications.
- **Centralized Admin Dashboard**: Manage sub-admins, stores, products, media, customers, orders, and analytics from a centralized dashboard.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Store-specific analytics with aggregated data across all stores managed by an admin.
